*In today's lesson we did so more fuze box activities. . For that lesson we programmed our fuze box to make jokes, our joke was " why were the harry potter films so unrealistic because the ginger kid had two friends".*

*We also programmed it to answer some simple mathematics questions. It can have a small conversation like for example,the conversation might be, "how many apples do you have?" and the reply would be “Well,if I had 10 apples but took one away,then I would have 9.”*

*If there was anything I could improve on(there are lots)one would be that I actually got involved instead of messing around a bit and laughing at poor Dan and Millan as it was so funny watching them work really hard. I admire them for their perseverance.*
