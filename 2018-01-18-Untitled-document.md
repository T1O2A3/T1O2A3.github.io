Blog N0.8

In todays lesson we carried on with python and did some more coding but then we learnt about how learning how to code isnt going to be easy but neither is anything else its just like playing a new intrument or a new sport your not great at it straight away you gradually get better as you practise more and its the same with coding that is the morall we learnt in todays lesson. We also got told to keep on practising everyday.
