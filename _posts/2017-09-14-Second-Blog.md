*Second Blog*

*In the lesson we used a new software or device called fuse.*

*In the lesson we partnered up a set up our own fuse box and played around with it for a bit but safely I had to leave half way through the lesson for a mouthgaurd fitting but when I came back I realised that my partner had set it up already and we had played around with it for a bit. Sadly though because I left half way through the lesson I wasn't able to get much done. We also got some hand booklets that are supposed to explain how to do all the different parts and sections of fuse which we will be reading another time.*
