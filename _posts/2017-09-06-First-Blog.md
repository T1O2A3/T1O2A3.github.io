*Blog No1*

*What Went Well?*

*I was able to completely delete my old blog page and make a new one in the time of the lesson which meant less homework. I also had enough time to start my first blog but not finish it.*

*What Didn't Go So Well?*

*I had forgotten my password to get into my github account which held me back from probably getting everything done in the lesson which was annoying.*

*What Will I Do Next Time?*

*I will make sure that I remember and write things down so that I don't forget them.*
