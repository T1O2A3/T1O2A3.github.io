**In today's lesson, we carried on with the FUZE box. We made a start on LEDs. It was very difficult for me and Dan as we didn't really understand the instructions from the booklet as the pictures were hard to tell where you insert the cable. I tried but failed.**

**By this, we could say that this lesson wasn't a successful one. If I could improve on anything, it would be that I donâ€™t give up so easily.**
