Today we looked at some more code academy and so I made some more progress.

In that code acadomy lesson I was able to go up to 40%. The main thing I was focusing on was lists and creating them. The next thing I did was some more things on strings and so that's what I spent the lesson doing. Then our homework was to do 30 mins at home which meant I was then on 45%.
